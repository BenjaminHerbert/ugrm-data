    <description>Building awesome web apps in Java? Using Vaadin or GWT? Let's share thoughts on Vaadin, GWT and web app
        development. Meetings are filled with presentations and debate on where these technologies are going, what can
        be done with them and what would be the best practices for using them.

            <name>Vaadin Frankfurt - First meetup</name>
            <description>Lets have the first Vaadin meet-up at the same evening we are having the GWT.create venue.
                After the meet-up everyone is free to join the GWT.create venue for networking and fun without any
                payments or tickets whatsoever.

                Please share your thoughts on what you wish to hear or discuss during the meet-up. We'll also gather
                practical ideas for 2014. Lets have this really casual and easy-going. And do note, there are a lot of
                Vaadin and GWT superstars present in the conference so we have the possibility to have really deep
                face-to-face discussions too if needed.
