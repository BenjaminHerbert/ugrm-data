    <description>The Frankfurt Cloud provides an infrastructure tool to support research in the appropriate application
        of clouds with regard to different user profiles, e.g. data intensive applications, compute intensive
        applications, communication intensive applications, intrinsically parallel application structures, and
        intrinsically sequential application structures. Moreover, the Frankfurt Cloud is a testbed to evaluate cloud
        products and service offerings of the market and to design and investigate novel cloud management concepts, e.
        g. load distribution, billing the users, and management of federated clouds. Our long-term goal is to contribute
        to a "cloud management technology" which also comprises questions like outsourcing and service componentization.
